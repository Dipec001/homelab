## Level 1 -> Level 2
**Goal:** Open the file present and get the password character within

```bash
- ls : to see the file content (the file is named -)
```
To read a dash file, we need to specify the filepath of the file like;
```bash
cat ./- # the file is named - and we specify the abs loc or path of the file to be able to open it
```
- The password gotten in it is - 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
