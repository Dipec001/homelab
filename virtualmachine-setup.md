Go to Storage > Empty (under Controller: IDE).

Click the CD icon > Choose a disk file, then select the Ubuntu ISO.

Click Start to boot from the ISO.

Enable OpenSSH (optional but recommended for remote access).

Wait for the installation to complete, then reboot.

6. Post-Installation Steps

Remove the installation media (ISO) from VirtualBox settings.

Log in with the credentials you created.

Run updates:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

(Optional) Enable SSH for remote access:

`sudo systemctl enable ssh`
`sudo systemctl start ssh`

(Optional) Check system logs:

`journalctl -xe`

7. Snapshot and Backup (Optional but Recommended)

In VirtualBox, go to Machine > Take Snapshot.

Name it something like <b> Fresh Install Backup.</b>

This allows you to restore the VM if needed.

This documentation ensures that I can quickly set up a new VM whenever needed. ðŸš€
