- `apt-cache search <package-name>`
- `apt-cache policy <package-name>` â†’ Shows the info(version etc) about the specified package
- `apt-get upgrade` > Updates all our packages

Many packages are available at the ubuntu repo and can easily be downloaded using this commands above but there are some 
packages/apps that you'll want to download using the terminal, that are not present there. Here's how we download;
- `sudo dpkg -i <path to the downloaded package>`

## File Permissions in Linux

Every file and directory has permissions for:
- `Owner (u)`
- `Group (g)`
- `Others (o)`

### ðŸ”¥ View File Permissions
```bash
ls -l
Example output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Mar 2 12:34 myfile.txt
```
### ðŸ›  Changing Permissions
- Numeric Method
chmod 755 myfile.txt  # Owner full, group + others read & execute
chmod 644 myfile.txt  # Owner full, group + others read only
- Symbolic Method
chmod u+x script.sh   # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write for group
chmod o+r file.txt    # Add read for others

### ðŸ”„ Changing Ownership
chown user:group file.txt  # Change owner and group
sudo chown root:root script.sh  # Change owner to root
