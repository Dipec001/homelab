## ðŸ”¹ Package management 
We can use apt(newer) or apt-get/apt-cache(older): for using apt, it encapsulates the two options of apt-get and apt-cache into
just apt.
- `apt-get install <package-name>` or `apt install <package-name>` â†’ Installs the package whose name is specified
- `apt-get remove <package-name>` â†’ Removes the package whose name is specified if installed
- `apt-cache search <package-name>*` â†’ It searches for available packages in your system's APT package cache that match the
 given name. The * wildcard allows for partial matches
- `apt-cache search <package-name>`
- `apt-cache policy <package-name>` â†’ Shows the info(version etc) about the specified package
- `apt-get upgrade` > Updates all our packages

Many packages are available at the ubuntu repo and can easily be downloaded using this commands above but there are some 
packages/apps that you'll want to download using the terminal, that are not present there. Here's how we download;
- `sudo dpkg -i <path to the downloaded package>`

## File Permissions in Linux

Every file and directory has permissions for:
- `Owner (u)`
- `Group (g)`
- `Others (o)`

### ðŸ”¥ View File Permissions
```bash
ls -l
Example output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Mar 2 12:34 myfile.txt
```
### ðŸ›  Changing Permissions
- Numeric Method
chmod 755 myfile.txt  # Owner full, group + others read & execute
chmod 644 myfile.txt  # Owner full, group + others read only
- Symbolic Method
chmod u+x script.sh   # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file.txt    # Remove write for group
chmod o+r file.txt    # Add read for others

### ðŸ”„ Changing Ownership
chown user:group file.txt  # Change d group
sudo chown root:root script.sh  # Change owner to root

## Find files/directories

`find [path] [options] [expression]`

`` â†’ The directory to start searching from (e.g., . for the current directory).

`` â†’ Filters like file type, permissions, modification time, etc.

`` â†’ Defines what to look for (e.g., -name "*.php").

Finding Files and Directories

### Find Files with a Specific Extension

`find . -type f -iname "*.php"`

. â†’ Searches from the current directory.

-type f â†’ Searches for files only (use -type d for directories).

-iname "*.php" â†’ Searches for files with a .php extension, case-insensitive (-name is case-sensitive).

### Find Directories Matching a Pattern

`find . -type d -iname "config*"`

Finds directories that start with "config".


### Find by Permissions

`find . -type f -perm 644`

Finds files with 644 permissions (owner can read/write, others can only read).

### Find and Execute a Command

`find . -type f -iname "*.php" -exec ls -lh {} \;`

-exec â†’ Runs a command on each result.

{} â†’ Represents each found file.

\; â†’ Marks the end of the -exec command.

### Find and Delete Files

`find . -type f -iname "*.log" -delete`

Deletes all .log files in the current directory and subdirectories.

### Find Files Modified Recently

`find . -type f -mtime -7`

- Finds files modified in the last 7 days.

`find . -type f -mmin -30`

- Finds files modified in the last 30 minutes.
### Find files by size

`find . -type f -name "*php" -size +50k`

- Finds file with name extension php and file size over 50kb
